# Machine Learning

This project has 4 machine learning models. Text classification, semantic search, keyword recommendataion, and spam classification. we are building the model using tensorflow and keras library. 

|Models|Output|Description|
|----|-----|-------|
|Text_Classification|binary with confidence score|Predicts the sentimen of a indonesian text. If confidence is >= 0.5, the text is considered as negative.|
|Spam_Classification|binary with confidence score|Predicts the spam of a indonesian text. If confidence is >= 0.5, the text is considered as spam.|
|semantic search|text similarity|predicts the user intent in search engine|
|Keyword recommendation|text similarity|Predicts the keyword that user passed in the text format|

## Installation

- after clonning the git, run one of the models ipynb files
- text_classification_V2 features Sentimen analysis that predicts various sentimen indonesian words. the code are using manual embedding or pretrained embedding also RNN or CNN deep learning model and you can choose between one of them. it has also 3 additional unsupervised machine learning model in the end that has each own features
- Spam_Detection features prediction of text spam of indonesian words. We are using a simple manual embedding and DNN deep learning model.
- Semantic_search features prediction of text spam of
